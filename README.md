# NitroDash
A WebGL Application that renders a 3D Racing car game on the web. 

## How NitroDash Works.

On the beginning of the application one views a home page that upon action, prompts you to choose which level to play the racegame. 
The goal of the race is to take the least time possible to complete a single lap in the game while also ensuring that time doesn't run out.
This racegame works in the following way
- Press S to start the game, P to play music and M to Mute
- Left and right arrow to change lanes, up and down to accelerate and decelerate respectively

## Features
1. Immersive 3D graphics powered by WebGL technology
2. Ability to change racetrack audio to song of your choice
3. Capability to change difficulty of levels
4. Multiple terrains for variability. These terrains are:
    - Barbie pink terrain
    - City terrain
    - Dark terrain
    - Desert terrain
    - Forest terrain
    - Snow terrain
    - Under sea terrain
    - X-mass terrain
